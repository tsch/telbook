Telbook is a simple telephone book with which you can manage a list of persons
and their home and mobile telephone numbers. Its purpose is not to provide you
with a full-fletched address book but to be a simple yet convenient tool.

You can add an entry by clicking "Add" and then typing the name and that
person's telephone numbers in the corresponding text entry fields. Hit [ENTER]
or [KP_ENTER] when done.

To modify existing entries, select the person you want to alter and then click
into the field you want to adjust, make your changes, and hit [ENTER] or
[KP_ENTER] to apply them, or [ESC] to cancel.

Existing entries can be deleted using the [DEL] key.

The filter area enables you to incrementally search the list of persons. The
list is automatically reduced to the entries matching what you enter.

With the "File → Open" menu entry you can load telephone books (the default
being "~/.local/share/telbook/telbook"). If there are already entries in the
list, you will be asked whether you want to replace the current list or
incorporate the new entries into it.

The "File → Save" menu entry saves the current list to the file associated with
it, whereas "File → Save As" will ask you to provide a file name.

Finally, "File → Quit" exits the program. If there are unsaved changes, you
will be asked whether you want to abandon them.

There are no commandline arguments or a configuration file. If
"~/.local/share/telbook/telbook" exists it will be read during startup.
