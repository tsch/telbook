Telbook is a simple telephone book with which you can manage a list of persons
and their home and mobile telephone numbers. Its purpose is not to provide you
with a full-fletched address book but to be a simple yet convenient tool.

You can add an entry by typing the name and that person's telephone numbers in
the corresponding text entry fields and then hitting either [ENTER] or
[KP_ENTER] or clicking the "Add" button.

In the same place you can also modify existing entries: In the list, select the
person you want to alter, make your changes, and click the "Replace" button to
apply them. If you click the "Add" button, a new entry will be created
alongside the old one. This is useful if, for example, you want to add a
relative of a person already in your list.

Existing entries can be deleted using the [DEL] key.

The filter area enables you to incrementally search the list of
persons. Whenever you change a criterion, the list is automatically reduced to
the entries matching the given filters.

With the "Open" button you can load telephone books (the default being
"~/.telbook"). If there already are entries in the list, you will be asked upon
opening whether you want to replace the current list or incorporate the new
entries into it.

The "Save" button saves the current list to the file associated with it,
whereas "Save As" will ask you to provide a file name.

Finally, "Quit" exits the program. If there are unsaved changes, you will be
asked whether you really want to abandon them.

There are no commandline arguments or a configuration file. If "~/.telbook"
exists it will be read during startup.
